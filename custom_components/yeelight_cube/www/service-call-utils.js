/**
 * Shared utility for calling Yeelight Cube Lite services on multiple target entities.
 *
 * Sends a SINGLE service call with entity_id as a list so the Python backend
 * can dispatch to all lamps in parallel via asyncio.gather.  This avoids the
 * Home Assistant WebSocket serialisation bottleneck where sequential
 * call_service messages would force the second lamp to wait for the first
 * to finish its transition.
 */

/**
 * Call a Yeelight Cube Lite service on every configured target entity.
 *
 * When multiple entities are targeted, they are sent as a list inside ONE
 * service call (`entity_id: ["light.a", "light.b"]`).  The Python handler
 * resolves all targets and runs them concurrently with `asyncio.gather`.
 *
 * @param {Object}   hass        - The Home Assistant `hass` object (provides callService).
 * @param {Object}   config      - Card configuration.  Reads `target_entities` (array)
 *                                  with a fallback to `entity` (single string).
 * @param {string}   serviceName - Service name under the `yeelight_cube` domain.
 * @param {Object}   [serviceData={}] - Extra data to pass alongside `entity_id`.
 * @param {Object}   [options={}]
 * @param {string}   [options.callerTag="ServiceCall"] - Tag for console error messages.
 * @returns {Promise<void>}

    # unreliable for this — it is guarded by a sentinel that skips on reload.
    #
    # IMPORTANT — caching:
    # The card files import their dependencies with un-versioned relative URLs
    # (e.g. `import { x } from "./gallery-mode-utils.js"`).  aiohttp's plain
    # static serving sends no Cache-Control, so browsers apply *heuristic*
    # freshness (≈10% of the file's age) and keep serving a stale dependency
    # for minutes after a deploy.  A freshly-deployed card that imports a NEW
    # export from a STALE cached dependency fails to evaluate → the custom
    # element is never defined → Lovelace shows an error card.
    #
    # A plain `no-cache` header fixes staleness but has a downside: it forces
    # the browser to make a *blocking network request* for every asset on
    # every load.  If the Home Assistant backend is briefly unreachable at that
    # moment (e.g. a reverse proxy / tunnel returning 502 Bad Gateway on a cold
    # morning load, which also makes HA's own frontend chunks and the websocket
    # fail), the fetch errors out with no cached fallback, so the cards fail to
    # load until a manual reload once the backend is warm.
    #
    # Fix: `max-age=0, stale-while-revalidate=86400, stale-if-error=86400`.
    # - max-age=0            -> always treat the cached copy as stale, so a new
    #                           deploy is always revalidated (no stale JS).
    # - stale-while-revalidate-> serve the cached copy immediately and revalidate
    #                           in the BACKGROUND (non-blocking), so a transient
    #                           backend 502 during load no longer breaks a card
    #                           that was cached on a previous visit.
    # - stale-if-error       -> if revalidation returns a 5xx / network error,
    #                           keep serving the last good copy.
    # NOTE: `must-revalidate` is intentionally NOT used -- it forbids serving a
    # stale copy on a failed revalidation, which directly contradicts (and can
    # override) stale-while-revalidate / stale-if-error.
    #
    # Honest limitations: this only helps assets that were cached on a PREVIOUS
    # load.  A truly first-ever load (empty cache) during a backend outage still
    # fails, and it cannot fix HA's own frontend_latest/*.js 502s -- those are

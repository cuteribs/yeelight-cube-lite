        Send command to Yeelight Cube Lite using a PERSISTENT socket (send-only).
        
        The Cube accepts multiple commands on the same TCP connection in direct
        FX mode.  Reusing a single socket avoids TIME_WAIT exhaustion: when we
        opened a new socket for every command, rapid pixel art switches (~5 in
        5 seconds) caused the lamp to reject connections as its TCP stack filled
        up with TIME_WAIT entries.
        
        Socket lifecycle:
          - Opened lazily on first command
          - Reused for subsequent commands (just sendall on existing socket)
          - Peer-close detection: before reuse, checks if the Cube has closed
            its end (select() with 0 timeout + recv peek).  The Cube's idle
            timeout resets on each received command, so the socket stays alive
            as long as commands flow.  When idle long enough, the Cube sends
            FIN which _check_peer_closed detects reliably on LAN.
          - Closed + reopened if send fails (broken pipe / connection reset),
            with 100ms settle for Cube TCP stack cleanup
          - NO proactive age-based close: previous versions RST-closed sockets
            after 8-28s, but this killed working sockets (the Cube's idle
            timeout counts from last received data, not connection open) and
            the immediate reconnect after RST often timed out.
          - Abortive close (SO_LINGER RST) — avoids TIME_WAIT socket exhaustion
